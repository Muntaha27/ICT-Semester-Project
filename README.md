CampusCarpool is a responsive website designed for university students to share rides easily and safely.  
It provides a simple way for students to connect with peers heading to the same destinations, reducing costs and promoting eco‑friendly travel.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Introduces the platform and explains how it works.
- **Rides Page**: Allows students to filter and select rides based on pickup, destination, date, and type.
- **Details Page**: Shows driver and car information, live rider counter, fare per rider auto‑calculation, and an embedded Google Maps route.

## Purpose
CampusCarpool helps students:
- Save money by splitting travel costs fairly.
- Travel safely with student‑verified drivers.
- Reduce traffic and emissions through carpooling.
- Build community by connecting with fellow students.

This project is intended as a beginner‑friendly example of building a complete, responsive website with practical features for everyday student life.
